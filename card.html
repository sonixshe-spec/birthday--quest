<h1>🎀 HAPPY BIRTHDAY BABYGIRL 🎀</h1>
<p>
From our endless sarcastic nok-jhok and teasing moments it’s been one unforgettable memory... 
You’ve been the person who could make me laugh even in the middle of chaos, the one who could turn even the dullest day into something lighter just by being you (by the OG stupid jokes too😭).

I still remember the silly fights, the dramatic replies, the calm pauses, and how we somehow always found our way back to conversations that made everything feel normal again. 
There was always this strange balance b/w your madness and my drama 💞

You’ve been my bbg, my constant tease, and the person who unknowingly became a part of my best memories. 
So today, on your birthday, I just wish you all the peace you give to others, all the laughter you spread, and all the happiness & love you deserve. 
Keep smiling that chaotic, pure smile of yours, and keep being the same “Bauna bbg” who never fails to make things brighter in his own weird ways.

With love,  
~ Sonal 💖
